CCTP Explorer API returns machine readable error codes, human readable error messages and a link to the docs for more information.

Here is how an error response looks like:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "body": {
    "errors": ["Invalid startDate. Must be a unixtimestamp."]
  }
}
```

## Error Codes

Here is a list of all error codes CCTP Explorer API returns:

### `bad_request`

- **Status:** 400 (Note: The HTTP response status will be `200`, but the JSON response will contain the actual status code)
- **Problem:** The request is malformed, either missing required fields, using wrong datatypes, or being syntactically incorrect.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure it is properly formatted. You need to check the status field in the JSON response, not the HTTP response status.

### `unauthorized`

- **Status:** 401
- **Problem:** The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
- **Solution:** Make sure you are using the correct API key or access token.

### `forbidden`

- **Status:** 403
- **Problem:** The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it because the client lacks proper permission.
- **Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the resource.

### `not_found`

- **Status:** 404
- **Problem:** The requested resource was not found.
- **Solution:** Check the request and make sure the resource exists.

### `internal_server_error`

- **Status:** 500
- **Problem:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **Solution:** Try again later. If the problem persists, contact support.

### `timeout`

- **Status:** 504
- **Problem:** The server did not respond in time.
- **Solution:** Try again later. If the problem persists, contact support.
