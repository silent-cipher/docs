## Welcome

Eigen Explorer offers a range of REST API endpoints designed for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the Eigen Layer ecosystem.

Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

## Eigen Layer

EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that introduces restaking, a new primitive in cryptoeconomic security. This primitive enables the reuse of ETH on the consensus layer. Users that stake ETH natively or with a liquid staking token (LST) can opt-in to EigenLayer smart contracts to restake their ETH or LST and extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network to earn additional rewards.
