## Welcome

Rescan offers a range of REST API endpoints designed for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the Eigen Layer ecosystem.
Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.
